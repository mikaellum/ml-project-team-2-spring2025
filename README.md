This repository containts initial code commit for stripping mp3 files of the information needed for\
training Neural Networks as well as cleaning the data and storing them into a pkl pandas database\
file. The [one pager](ML-Sprint3-DataCleanup.pdf) explicitly outlines the steps taken to clean the
data, extract features and make it\
ready for training.

The database can be found in [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16TARdsLzhNxwRzCyQJbUkq965KdaCUmH/view?usp=drive_link) google drive. We chose to keep it there since it is ~10GB and will\
not fit in this repo.

Thanks!
